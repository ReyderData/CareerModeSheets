# CareerModeSheets
--My own Excel Sheets for my Career Mode follow-up--

Here I will explain what is the content of each of the Sheets in the file.

First of all in the first one I save all the signings and departures data.
I also track here the economic balance regarding players transfers money, the run total and a per year balance.

In the signings table I added a conditional formatting that whenever I click into a cell, the whole row is filled in a green color for an easy read.
In the balance section we can see the total income and outcome and we can select a specific season to see that particular balance.

There is also a Sheet for the players stats along the game.
I included a basic searching tool where you choose the season and player and if there is an existing match then the corresponding row is highlighted.
I did the tool with a formula in the conditional formatting.

The next Sheet was simply a reduced view of the stats table where I recover the main data from the table with a small macro.
With a button and two dropdowns for the season and player we can get the desired data.

In the end I show the tests sheet where I try things and where I keep lists that I may need and use in other sheets.
In the shared file there are a unique values list for all the players that played at least one game with the team and a sequence to get all the seasons cells.
